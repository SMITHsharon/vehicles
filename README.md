# vehicles

### Project Description 

This exercise, written in C#, converted given code into a system that is more flexible and extensible to accomodate any kind of vehicle class. Each class is designed to implement only the code that it needs. Emphasis for this exercise is to implement the Interface Segregation Principle and the Dependency Inversion Principle of SOLID.

### Project Specs
#### Part 1
- Converted given code into a system that is more flexible and extensible to accomodate any kind of vehicle class. 
- Each class implements only the code that it needs. 
- Created at least two types of each vehicle (water based, ground based, and air based).  
- Built separate collections of all vehicles that are air-based (can fly), land-based (can drive), and water-based (can drive). 
- Used a single for each statement for each collection, to have each vehicle fly/drive (output). 


### Technologies Used

- Visual Studio Code
